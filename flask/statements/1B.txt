John is playing baseball, and he's very good at it. In fact, he was so good at the game yesterday that the pitcher decided to threaten him. The pitcher gives John a number n, and challenges John to find all the prime factors of such a number n. John has always been terrible at math, so its your job to find out 

Input:

The first line contains the number of test cases t. The next t lines each contain a number n

Output :

Do the following t times:
	First output a number k
	Then output k numbers seperated by spaces, the prime factors of that test case, such that the product of all of these numbers is equal to the answer. These numbers should be in ascending order.

In total, 2t lines should be present.

Constraints: 1 <= t <= 1000 | 1 <= n <= 10^6
Time Limit : 1 second
Memory Limit: FUCK YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS
